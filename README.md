# VI in BASIC

This is a copy of the text editor **Vi** in _**C64 BASIC**._

## What is BASIC?

_**BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)**_ is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages designed in 1964 **for ease of use by non-technical users and students**. 
It was originally developed at Dartmouth College by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz.

## Why am I using BASIC instead of something like Python or Scratch?

Almost all of us have never tried **BASIC**. So I wanted to see if I could code Vi in **BASIC**.
